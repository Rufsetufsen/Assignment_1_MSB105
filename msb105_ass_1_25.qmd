## Introduction

This mini-paper is based on the university lecture "Robust and Reliable Science" [@gjestland2024] (Gjestland) which highlights the need for reproducibility in research.

In recent years, scientific research has faced scrutiny due to concerns about the reproducibility of published findings [@mcnutt2014 page 229].
The term "*reproducibility*" refers to the ability of independent researchers to obtain the same scientific results when using the original data and scientific methods.
Reproducibility is also a necessary condition for *replicable* research, which involves *"The confirmation of results and conclusions from one study obtained independently in another."* [@jasny2011b p 1225].

Both reproducibility and replicability are central to the credibility of empirical research, yet evidence suggests that a large share of published research across many academic disciplines fail to meet these standards.

Definer research reproducibility og dets viktighet.
Lag kobling mellom etterprøvbar vitenskap og økonomi/data science.
Viktighet for godt beslutningsgrunnlag i policymaking, etc.

## The Reproducibility Crisis

Sett lys på problemer nevnt i foredraget: Publication bias, dårlig dokumentasjon.
Eksempel fra psykologifeltet.
Hent kilder fra økonomifaget.

## Principles of Robust and Reliable Science

Robuste metoder Transparency (datadeling, open source kode)

## Implications for Data Science in Economics

Why reproducibility matters for policy advice, forecasting etc.
Case examples (psychology vs. econ) Reproducbility tools (focus on quarto)

## Conclusion

Oppsummering av nøkkelpunkter.
Reproducibility crisis is not only caused by technical limitations, but also cultural issues (publication bias, incentives).

## Literature review / Further reading(?)

Smart stuff from others about the topic.

Use a least 20 citations, a least 5 of them must be new (not from the provided .bib file).

Use both in-line and normal citations.

Example:

@gentleman2005 argues that bla bla bla.
On the other hand it's claimed that bla bla [@barbalorenaa.2018; @bartlett2008].

## Discussion of the reseach question

-   Should replicability be the norm or is this to much to ask for now?
-   Can Quarto documents help with reproducibility?
-   What problems remains and how can these be solved?
