## Introduction

This mini-paper is based on the university lecture "Robust and Reliable Science" [@gjestland2024] which highlights the need for reproducibility in research.

In recent years, scientific research has come under scrutiny due to concerns about the reproducibility of published findings [@mcnutt2014 page 229].
The term "*reproducibility*" refers to the ability of independent researchers to obtain the same scientific results when using the original data and scientific methods.
Reproducibility is also a necessary condition for *replicable* research, which involves *"The confirmation of results and conclusions from one study obtained independently in another."* [@jasny2011b p 1225].

Both reproducibility and replicability are central to the credibility of empirical research, yet evidence suggests that quite a large share of published research across many academic disciplines fail to meet these standards.

## The Reproducibility Crisis

The reproducibility crisis first became visible in the academic fields of psychology and medicine before it reached economics.
The open Science @opensciencecollaboration2015 found that only 36 percent of their tested psychology studies were replicable.
In preclinical cancer research, @begleyRaiseStandardsPreclinical2012 showed that only a small fraction of results could be reproduced and/or scientifically validated.

The field of Economics has not been spared either.
@camerer2016 attempted to replicate 18 experimental studies and found that only 61 percent showed effects in the same direction, and even then the average replicated effect size was only 66 percent of the original.
@miguel2021 emphasises that selective publishing and inacessible datasets create barriers to replication.
The reproducibility issue seems to be a composite of both inacessible data and statistics, but also culture and incentives.
"Significant" results get rewarded with publishing, while null-findings get ignored and end up in a desk drawer somewhere.
Publication bias incentivizes cherry-picking of results to obtain p-values below 0,05 [@miguel2021 pp 194].
The "positive outcome bias" is not only distorting the scientific literature, but it can also pressure scientists to fabricate and falsify their data [@fanelli2012].

For an academic discipline like economics where evidence is used to justify political reforms, this can have lasting real-world consequences for millions of people, and it creates a real credibility problem for the field.

## Principles of Robust and Reliable Science

*"Robust and reliable research is **the foundation of all scientific development** and progress, which depends critically on the ability of investigators to build on prior work."* [@gjestland2024]

So what is robust and reliable research?
The wise man doesn't feel the need to invent the wheel twice, so I choose to use the same definition as @bollen2015: [they] *"view robust scientific* *findings as ones that are reproducible, replicable, and generalizable."*

This means that:

1.  A researcher should be able to duplicate the results from a prior study with the same method and materials as the original researcher (reproducibility).
2.  A researcher should be able to duplicate the results from a prior study with the same method and collect new results using different data (replicability).
3.  The results from the research should be able to be generalized across other similar contexts (generalizability).

## Implications for Data Science in Economics

Why reproducibility matters for policy advice, forecasting etc.
Case examples (psychology vs. econ) Reproducbility tools (focus on quarto)

## Conclusion

Oppsummering av nøkkelpunkter.
Reproducibility crisis is not only caused by technical limitations, but also cultural issues (publication bias, incentives).

## Literature review / Further reading(?)

Smart stuff from others about the topic.

Use a least 20 citations, a least 5 of them must be new (not from the provided .bib file).

Use both in-line and normal citations.

Example:

@gentleman2005 argues that bla bla bla.
On the other hand it's claimed that bla bla [@barbalorenaa.2018; @bartlett2008].

## Discussion of the reseach question

-   Should replicability be the norm or is this to much to ask for now?
-   Can Quarto documents help with reproducibility?
-   What problems remains and how can these be solved?
