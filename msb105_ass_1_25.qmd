## Introduction

This mini-paper is based on the university lecture "Robust and Reliable Science" (Gjestland) which highlights the need for reproducibility in research.

Definer research reproducibility og dets viktighet.
Lag kobling mellom etterprøvbar vitenskap og økonomi/data science.
Viktighet for godt beslutningsgrunnlag i policymaking, etc.

## The Reproducibility Crisis

Sett lys på problemer nevnt i foredraget: Publication bias, dårlig dokumentasjon.
Eksempel fra psykologifeltet.
Hent kilder fra økonomifaget.

## Principles of Robust and Reliable Science

Robuste metoder Transparency (datadeling, open source kode)

## Implications for Data Science in Economics

Why reproducibility matters for policy advice, forecasting etc.
Case examples (psychology vs. econ) Reproducbility tools (focus on quarto)

## Conclusion

Oppsummering av nøkkelpunkter.
Reproducibility crisis is not only caused by technical limitations, but also cultural issues (publication bias, incentives).

## Literature review / Further reading(?)

Smart stuff from others about the topic.

Use a least 20 citations, a least 5 of them must be new (not from the provided .bib file).

Use both in-line and normal citations.

Example:

@gentleman2005 argues that bla bla bla.
On the other hand it's claimed that bla bla [@barbalorenaa.2018; @bartlett2008].

## Discussion of the reseach question

-   Should replicability be the norm or is this to much to ask for now?
-   Can Quarto documents help with reproducibility?
-   What problems remains and how can these be solved?

## Conclusion
